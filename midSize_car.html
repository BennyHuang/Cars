				<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>
				<p>Mid-size cars are also called large family cars in Euro. Mid-size cars have room for five adults and a large trunk (boot). Engines are more powerful than small family/compact cars and some may have engines of more than 2.5 litres. Car sizes were usually around 4.50 m in length by the early 1990s, but are now shifting to 4.80 m or more in length. </p>

											<p>In 1982 for the 1983 model year, the Camry became an independent model line from Celica Camry, and was sold as a mid-size four-door sedan, five-door hatchback and a more luxurious version of the Camry named Camry Vista sold in the Japanese market. It was available with a 92hp 2.0L I4 engine or a 74hp 2.0L I4 turbodiesel engine, and could be purchased with either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic. In contrast to the rear-wheel drive Celica Camry, the Toyota Camry was a front-wheel drive vehicle built on an all-new platform V10. The design of the first-generation Camry fit well within the box-shaped trends of the early 1980s. Additionally, the vehicle size and available options were characteristic of Japanese-designed cars of the time; the Camry was a small, inexpensive sedan with solid but spartan construction and competed indirectly against larger American counterparts.</p>

											<p>The second-generation model debuted in 1986 with V20 platform for the 1987 model year, and included a station wagon but dropped the hatchback. In 1988, all-wheel drive (called All-Trac) and a 160hp 2.5L V6 engine, that featured dual overhead camshafts, were added as options for the first time. In 1991, anti-lock brakes became optional on the V6, LE, and wagon models. The 2.5 L engine and Camry chassis was repackaged as the upscale Lexus ES 250. The second-generation Camry was extremely popular in US.</p>

											<p>The Camry V30 was introduced exclusively to the Japanese market in July 1990. The third-generation Camrys had rounded features and a very curved silhouette. A widened version of this model, the Camry XV10 was also produced in 1991, which was designed for international markets. The V30 was mostly identical to the wider XV10 except for the front- and rear-end styling to an otherwise unchanged body. The V30 remained smaller than the XV10 to offer Japanese buyers a sedan that was within Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement. After 1991, a four-wheel steering version of the V30 Camry was sold with a 2.0L V6 engine, with the name "Toyota Camry V6 Prominent 4WS".</p>

											<p>The fourth-generation Camry was launched in Japan in December 1996 based on V40. It continued as a sedan and station wagon. It was launched in the US for the 1997 model year. In 2000, the sedan models received a mid-model upgrade to the front and rear fascias, but remained otherwise similar to the 1999 models. The Lexus ES 300 was again built from the Camry chassis. Power was increased slightly to 133hp for the 5S-FE 2.2 L I4 and 194hp for the 1MZ-FE V6. For the General Export Market, the Camry was offered as 2.2 GLX and 3.0 V6 Grande. This was the first Camry to be sold as a Daihatsu; the Daihatsu Altis was identical to the export version of the Camry. The XV10 replacement, the XV20 Camry, arrived in 1996 as well.

											<p>In September 2001, the 2002 model year Toyota Camry was released as a larger sedan, but without a station wagon for the first time. Due to station wagons losing popularity to minivan and crossover SUVs, the Camry wagon was replaced by the Highlander SUV, which utilizes the Camry's platform. Starting from this generation, the Camry had two different distinctive designs, an American version with a more conservative design and an Asian version with more chrome, larger head lamps and tail lamps and a general greater emphasis on its width. Later generation Camry will see greater differentiation, with the Asian Camry adopting a more luxurious design, while the American Camry pursued a more mass-appeal approach. </p>

											<p>The XV40 Camry was introduced at the 2006 North American International Auto Show alongside a hybrid version and went on sale in March 2006 for the 2007 model year. This generation of Camry saw even greater differentiation between American/Japanese domestic market Camry and the Asian market Camry. The Asian Camry has a larger body size targeted at a higher end market, priced just below entry-level German luxury models. Between 2006 and 2010, the Daihatsu-badged Altis model sold alongside the Camry in Japan. The Daihatsu differed only in badging, with no cosmetic changes. Power comes from a choice of four and six-cylinder engines. The 2.4L 2AZ-FE I4 engine came with a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. The 3.5L 2GR-FE V6 in contrast came with a new six-speed automatic. The Camry was facelifted in 2009 for the 2010 model year with a redesigned fascia, taillights, and an all-new 2.5L 2AR-FE four-cylinder engine with a new six-speed automatic transmission. Power locks, stability control, and traction control were also made standard for 2010. The XV40 series Camry is the first in which the Camry has been available as a gasoline/electric hybrid. The Camry Hybrid utilizes Toyota’s second-generation Hybrid Synergy Drive (HSD) and a 2AZ-FXE four-cylinder with 150hp in conjunction with a 40hp electric motor.</p>

The Camry line-up for the Japanese domestic market was reduced to being hybrid only. The Japanese market will now share the same Camry model as the Asian market Camry. Power output has been increased mostly by switching to electro-hydraulic power steering. All models are standard with 6-speed automatic transmissions. No manual transmissions are offered. The new model has increased fuel economy due to lighter weight, a sleeker body, and low rolling-resistance tires.</p>

											<p>The original Volkswagen Passat was launched in 1973. The body types offered originally were two- and four-door sedans and similar looking three- and five-door versions. Externally all four shared a modern fastback style design, styled by the Italian designer <b>Giorgetto Giugiaro</b>. In essence, the first Passat was a fastback version of the mechanically identical <b>Audi 80</b> sedan. A five-door station wagon/estate was introduced in 1974. The Passat was one of the most modern European family cars at the time. The Passat originally used the four-cylinder OHC 1.3L (54hp) and 1.5L(74hp/84hp) petrol engines with either a four-speed manual transmission or three-speed automatic. It had a MacPherson strut front suspension with a solid axle/coil spring setup at the rear. In July 1978 the Passat Diesel became available, equipped with the VW Golf's 1.5L Diesel(49hp), followed in February 1979 by the <b>Passat GLI</b> with a Bosch fuel-injected version of the 1.6L engine. In North America, the car was called the Volkswagen Dasher. A sports version, named Passat TS 1.6 and later Passat GTS 1.8 Pointer was also introduced.

In addition to the Passat hatchbacks and wagon, there was also a conventional three-box saloon, which was sold as the <b>Volkswagen Santana</b>. In North America, the Passat/Santana was sold as the Volkswagen Quantum. The four-wheel drive Syncro version was introduced in October 1984, initially only with the more powerful 2L five-cylinder engine. The Santana was also produced in China and South America. As of 2012 the B2 Santana is still in production in China. An <b>automatic stop/start</b> was also available in some markets. The four-wheel drive system used in the Passat Variant Syncro shared the mechanics of the Audi 80 quattro rather than the Volkswagen Golf Syncro. On March 31, 1988 production ended with 3,345,248 built in Germany. World production totals amount to at least 4.5 million.</p>

											<p>The third generation Passat was introduced in March 1988. The lack of a grille made the car's front end styling reminiscent of older, rear-engined Volkswagens and also doubled as a modern styling trend. It was the first transverse-engine layout Passat to be built on a Volkswagen-designed platform, rather than sharing one with an Audi saloon. The car, although designated B3 in Volkswagen's platform nomenclature, was based largely on the A platform as used for the smaller Golf model, but was stretched. Only 4-door saloon and 5-door estate versions were available. The 5-door hatchback version is no longer available. It was marketed under the Passat name in all markets. The new VR6 2.8L engine gave the top-of-the-range Passat a top speed of 224kmph.</p>

											<p>The seventh generation was released in September 2000. While the redesign retained the previous generation's exterior dimensions, interior space was improved in part by using a flat rear floor. The front suspension was changed from that of a double wishbone to a MacPherson strut, in order to lower costs, as well as allow more engine bay room for the newly introduced Honda K-series engine. The Type R was redesigned as well using a more powerful i-VTEC motor (K20A2, 200ps) and using the three-door hatchback body style.
